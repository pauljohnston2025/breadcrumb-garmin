A garmin watch datafield that shows a breadcrumb trail. For watches that do not support breadcrumb navigation out of the box.

commpanion app https://github.com/pauljohnston2025/breadcrumb-mobile.git
Can be used without the companion app, but will only show current track. 
Use the companion app to add a route that you can follow.

Intended for use with round watches, but will work on others (might not look the best though)
Some watches/devices with touch support will be able switch between elevation and track view during activity.
